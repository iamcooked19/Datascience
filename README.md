Task 1: EDA and Visualization
Dataset Used: Titanic Dataset / Airbnb Listings Dataset
Goal: Explore the data, clean it, and visualize key patterns.
Steps Performed:
Loaded dataset using Pandas.
Cleaned the data (handled missing values, removed duplicates, and treated outliers).
Plotted:
Bar charts for categorical variables.
Histograms for numerical variables.
Correlation heatmap.
How to Run:
Open VS Code.
Open task1.py.
Press Ctrl + F5 or right-click in the editor and select "Run Python File in Terminal".
Task 2: Text Sentiment Analysis
Dataset Used: IMDB Reviews
Goal: Classify review sentiments as positive or negative.
Steps Performed:
Preprocessed text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
Transformed text using TF-IDF.
Trained a sentiment classifier (Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes).
Evaluated with Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
How to Run:
Open task2.py in VS Code.
Run the file using Ctrl + F5.
Task 3: Fraud Detection System
Dataset Used: Credit Card Fraud Dataset
Goal: Detect fraudulent transactions.
Steps Performed:
Handled data imbalance (e.g., using SMOTE or undersampling).
Trained a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting classifier.
Evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
Created a command-line interface for testing.
How to Run:
Open task3.py
Run the script in VS Code.
Follow on-screen prompts to test transactions.
Task 4: House Price Prediction (Boston Housing)
Goal: Predict house prices using custom-built regression models.
Steps Performed:
